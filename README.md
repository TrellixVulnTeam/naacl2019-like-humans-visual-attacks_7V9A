> **Abstract:** Visual modifications to text are often used to obfuscate offensive comments in social media (e.g., ''!d10t'') or as a writing style (''1337'' in ''leet speak''), among other scenarios.
We consider this as a new type of adversarial attack in NLP,  a 
setting
to which humans are very robust, 
as our experiments with both simple and more difficult visual perturbations demonstrate.
We 
investigate 
the impact of visual adversarial attacks
on current NLP systems on character-, word-, and sentence-level tasks, 
showing 
that both neural and non-neural models are, in contrast to humans, 
extremely sensitive to such attacks, 
suffering performance decreases of up to 82\%. 
We then explore three shielding methods---visual character embeddings, adversarial training, and rule-based recovery---which
substantially improve the robustness of the models.
However, the shielding methods still fall behind performances achieved in 
non-attack scenarios, which demonstrates the difficulty of dealing with visual attacks.

## Project Description

### Embeddings

We created diverse embeddings, including 576 dimensional visual Character Embeddings (called `vce.normalized` in the folder below). All embeddings and weights can be found [on our public file server](https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/naacl2019-like-humans-visual-attacks/).

Below we include a tsne visualization of the visual character representations from `vce.normalized` (restricted to the first 250 chars).

### Additional Resources

  * **VIPER** is our visual text perturber. See [code/VIPER](code/VIPER)
  * Our **G2P model** is described in [code/G2P](code/G2P)
  * The code for our **POS Tagging and Chunking** experiments is available in [code/POS_Chunk](code/POS_Chunk)
  * The code to run the **Toxic Comment Classification** experiments can be found in [code/TC](code/TC)

### Semantic Similarity Sanity Check

We additionally performed a semantic similarity "sanity check" to check whether VELMo assigns higher cosine similarity to a pair of (clean,perturbed) sentences than SELMo. The pairs are of the form: 

```Greetings Hey douche bag wassup```
```Grëȩtinɋs Ηey ḏoʋchḛ bag ✿ąssɥp```

The code can be found in [code/sanity_check](code/sanity_check)

### AllenNLP modifications

To run the visually informed models, we did some modifications on the AllenNLP code. The modified versions can be found in `code/AllenNLP_Modifications` and are necessary to obtain the respective embedding representations for _toxic comment classification_, _chunking_, and _POS tagging_.
